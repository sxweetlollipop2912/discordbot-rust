### Broken! And I'm too ~~lazy~~ occupied with school these days.
`online_lavalink_server branch` is dedicated for [SomethingHost `Lavalink` server](https://support.something.host/en/article/lavalink-hosting-okm26z/) version.
<br><br>
In other words, this version is basically the same as `local_lavalink_server branch`, and will be updated along with in future commits.
<br>
One exception being that `Lavalink` server in `local branch` is run locally, while `online branch` uses free online [`Lavalink` server](https://support.something.host/en/article/lavalink-hosting-okm26z/), credited to [SomethingHost](https://something.host).
<br><br>
It is preferable to host bot online (on Heroku, for instance) using `online_lavalink_server branch` version, as it would consume much less RAM than `local branch`.
<br>
If stable connection and smooth experience is prioritized, go for `local_lavalink_server branch` version.
<br><br>
The bot is pretty much incomplete. Only very basic commands are available. However, if one wishes to try this bot out, one can do so by having one's own server and following this [invitation link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=884998336690659348&permissions=140697234512&scope=bot).

Obviously, I have no intention of tracking any personal data. Feel free to enjoy ;)
