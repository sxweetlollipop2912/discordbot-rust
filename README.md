### Broken! And I'm too ~~lazy~~ occupied with school these days.
`online_lavalink_server` branch uses [SomethingHost Lavalink server](https://support.something.host/en/article/lavalink-hosting-okm26z/).
<br>
`local_lavalink_server` branch runs Lavalink server locally.
<br><br>
`online` branch consumes much less RAM than `local` branch, preferred when hosting online.
<br>
If stable connection and smooth experience is prioritized, choose `local` branch.
